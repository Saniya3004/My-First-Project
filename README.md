# My-First-Project
Simulating a Realistic Road Experience with Traffic Lights, Moving Car & Trees - Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!

We recently built an interactive Car Simulation Web Page as part of a creative front-end project! This project visually recreates a roadside experience featuring animated traffic lights, a moving car, and roadside trees - all designed using core web technologies.

The objective was to simulate a lifelike environment using smooth transitions and DOM manipulation, all while practicing real-time visual interactivity!

# Key Features Implemented:

Traffic Light System - Red, Yellow & Green lights with automatic timed transitions

Car Movement Logic - Car starts, slows down, or stops based on signal changes

Dynamic Road & Lane Styling - Realistic lanes using CSS gradients

Tree Placement - Visual roadside enhancement using positioned SVG trees

Responsive Visual Design - Works across different screen sizes.

# Tech Stack Used:
HTML - For the structure of road, traffic light, car, and tree elements.

CSS To style road, background, trees, car, and to simulate realistic environments.

JavaScript - To handle signal changes, timing logic, and car movement across the screen.

Thank you.
